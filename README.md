# SugarcaneESTs
Transcript expression across diverse EST libraries from PMID:1461397

## Methods

Sugarcane ESTs were downloaded from NCBI, separated by library and then expression values (counts perl transcript per library) were computed for each transcript in each library with Salmon 1.8.0 againt the SUCEST transcript assembly.

Counts were transformed into Counts Per Thousand (CPT).
